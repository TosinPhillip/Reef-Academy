# Reef Academy
 
Reef Academy is an academic testing platform that is aiming at becoming the world's most trusted academic testing platform. Just like we have Duolingo for languages, HackerRank for coding, Reef is gunning for a position in that rank. Academic testing should be safe, standard and helpful. 
* Safe in that it is free from examination malpractices in all forms - examiners know their questions are not revealed before time; students know their details and cores are completely safe
* Standard in that its questions and testing environment are top of the shelf - questions are well-crafted to assess and evaluate specific abilities, the environment is no disadvantage to any learner and recipients of exams know that their results are true reports of their abilities.
* Helpful in that there are enough practice questions and exam simulations with correction and resources to prepare for any exam with very friendly learning curves.

These are our targets at Reef. We are setting out small but we have a spot in mind at the top. Support us.
